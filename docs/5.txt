On the occasion of World Mental Health Day, the college organized a 10-kilometer marathon themed “Run for the Mind.” Over 500 students, faculty members, and even alumni participated. The run started from the main gate and looped through scenic parts of the campus. The Dean of Student Welfare flagged off the event. Volunteers at water booths cheered participants, and medical teams stood by for emergencies. The objective was to promote mental well-being and destigmatize mental health issues. Information booths were set up at the finish line, offering free consultations and wellness kits. T-shirts with motivational quotes like “Strong Mind, Strong Life” were distributed. The event also featured guest speakers who shared personal stories of overcoming stress and anxiety. Funds raised through registration were donated to student counseling services. The initiative was widely appreciated, and many requested such activities become regular. The marathon proved that sports can powerfully advocate social and emotional causes.
